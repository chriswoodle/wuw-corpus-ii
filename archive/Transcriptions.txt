  a.. “[…]”   - Should be replaced by actual Text. 
  b.. “0”’s    - Of Start Time and End Time should be replaced by actual measurement in unit of seconds  (e.g., 0.588). 
  c.. First 32 calls have Dialect column all set to non-native due to an error. This needs correction based on the best judgment of the transcriber.
